I"<p>Memair lets you know where youâ€™ve been, which is wonderful. But quantifying yourself also lets you know where you havenâ€™t been. After asking Memair â€œWhere have I been this yearâ€ and then zooming in on my hometown, I found lots of areas that I havenâ€™t recently explored.</p>

<p>This weekendâ€™s challenge is to offset FOMO (fear of missing out) by exploring the recently unexplored.</p>
