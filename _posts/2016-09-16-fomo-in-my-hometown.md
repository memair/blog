Memair lets you know where you've been, which is wonderful. But quantifying yourself also lets you know where you haven't been. After asking Memair "Where have I been this year" and then zooming in on my hometown, I found lots of areas that I haven't recently explored.

This weekend's challenge is to offset FOMO (fear of missing out) by exploring the recently unexplored.
