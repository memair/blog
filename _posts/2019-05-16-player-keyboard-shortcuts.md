[Memair Player](https://memair.com/player) now respects keyboard shortcuts. No more useless half page scroll when you try to pause a video.

| Key        | Action                                 |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `0` to `9` | Seek from 0 to 90% respectively        |
| `space`    | Toggle playback                        |
| `K`        | Toggle playback                        |
| &larr;     | Seek backward by the `seekTime` option |
| &rarr;     | Seek forward by the `seekTime` option  |
| &uarr;     | Increase volume                        |
| &darr;     | Decrease volume                        |
| `M`        | Toggle mute                            |
| `F`        | Toggle fullscreen                      |

Thank you to the [plyr.io](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr) team on which Memair Player is based.
